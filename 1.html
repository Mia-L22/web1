    <p style="margin-top:100px;">
      A meat pie is a pie with a chunky filling of meat and often other savory ingredients. They are popular in the United Kingdom,[1] Australia, Ghana, Nigeria, Europe, New Zealand, Canada, Zimbabwe and South Africa.
      As with most pies, the pasty is usually baked, fried, or deep fried at a high enough temperature to induce the Maillard reaction, which changes the colour of the pastry to a golden or brown colour, and greatly increases the pasty's richness and flavour.
      Depending on how the pastry is prepared, when cooked the pastry might also acquire a tender, flaky structure.
      <br>It depends upon the talent of the chef to achieve the desired pastry effect while also cooking the internal filling to achieve food safety at a desired service temperature;
      meat pies are often served hot, sometimes far too hot to quickly consume.
      Tender cuts of meat tend to become tough at higher temperatures, whereas tough cuts of meat with more connective tissue can become more tender at higher temperatures, so the cooking strategy will often vary depending on the filling contents.
      In some cases, it may be necessary to partially precook either the filling or the crust to obtain the desired balance of effects in the final pie.
